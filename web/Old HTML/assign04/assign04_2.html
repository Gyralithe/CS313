  <h2>Explanation</h2>
  <p id="introp">
    Follows here a table explaining the purpose of each skill set generally available to all characters. 
    Even in normal D&D it can be a bit vague as to what each is really useful for. Since this is 
    <em>not</em> normal D&D but instead a Star Wars variation, I believe this further documentation 
    will prove helpful.
