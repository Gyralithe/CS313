  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p id="introp">
    Hi, my name's Tim. This is a page I've created for the D&D group I'm currently running.
    We're a group of 4 for now: me, Jordan (my sister), Evgeniy (a friend and rather inexperienced
    player) and Austin (another friend with more experience). As you might have figured out, this is
    a D&D campaign in the context of Star Wars, and as there's not really any standarized rulebook for
    this version, I've had to come up with a lot of my own rules, some of which are explained on
    the "Skill Resources" page.

<div class="text">
  <h2>The Characters</h2>
  <div class="charheader">
    <span>Player: </span>Jordan
    <span> || Name: </span>Reyla
    <span> || Race: </span>Twi'lek
    <span> || Class: </span>Animal Hunter
  </div>
  <div class="chardescription">
    <p class="pdescription">
      Reyla is a smuggler that specializes in hunting down (often capturing rather than killing) the fauna
      of the galaxy, both rare and mundane. Her she often uses a long-range blaster as her go-to weapon,
      but also uses a variety of traps and tools to stay a step ahead of her prey. She much prefers animals
      to people (whom she generally considers just another form of animal) and her only true friend is
      Moonfisher, of the rare <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thernbee" target="_blank">Thernbee</a> 
      species.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br/>

  <div class="charheader">
    <span>Player: </span>Evgeniy
    <span> || Name: </span>Jeka
    <span> || Race: </span>Human
    <span> || Class: </span>Force Acolyte
  </div>
  <div class="chardescription">
    <p class="pdescription">
      Jeka (pronounced ZHE-ka) once lived as a farm boy on a practically unknown planet of the Outer Rim. 
      However, early in his childhood he began to manifest a connection to the Force. His power developed, 
      though he little understood it. As strong as he felt, he knew there was little he could do to fully 
      fully eliminate the band of pirates that consistently harrassed his people. That is, until a Jedi 
      Knight by the name of Mao'dak arrived to train him and prepare his people to repel their tormentors. 
      Though they did accomplish their goal, Mao'dak was killed as they fought. Now Jeka, armed with some 
      small training in the Force and his own lightsabers, roams the galaxy in search of other Jedi.
    </p>

  <div class="charheader">
    <span>Player: </span>Austin
    <span> || Name: </span>Benji
    <span> || Race: </span>Human
    <span> || Class: </span>Pilot
  </div>
  <div class="chardescription">
    <p class="pdescription">
      Benji has gained a reputation in many systems as a trustworthy and able pilot, and he has earned it. 
      However, there are many that also know recognize him as a hitman. His work isn't often subtle, but he's
      never failed a contract. With a hefty amount of skill in piloting, space navigation, demolitions, ranged
      combat and hand-to-hand fighting, Benji is worth a small army in the right situation. He is always
      accompanied by his droid R5-T5 or "Fives" who, for the most part, acts as Benji's co-pilot and enables 
      him to get into places that would otherwise be inaccessible.
