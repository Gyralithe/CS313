    <p>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is perhaps my favorite game of all time. In my mind, story generally trumps gameplay (or anything else) and in mindset this game is king. It tells the tale of a royal guard and his quest to free his king and princess from their cursed forms as gremlin and horse. Of course, there are many other adventures to be had along the way with some truly unique and memorable characters. Accompanying all of it is a fantastic, fully orchestrated soundtrack that would deserve praise even standing on its own. Truly, a masterpiece of a game.</p>

  <div class="info">
    <p>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age, in my opinion, comes in as a very close second to its predecessor DQVIII. Once again, the game tells a fantastic story, this time about a relatively normal group of heroes on their quest to literally stop the world from ending. Each of the party's 8 characters comes with great stories of their own and all contribute to the telling of the tale. Beyond just storytelling, the game provides a marvelous world to explore with many memorable locations and people. Lastly, DQXI significantly improves on the turn-based battle style iconic of the series, making combat engaging and exciting.</p>

    <p>Batman: Arkham Knight is the pinnacle and climax of the very successful Arkham series. Above all, this game fully immerses you in the world of the Dark Knight. His many gadgets, stealth tactics, high-speed combat abilities, and even the Batmobile are yours to use to fight the familiar (and some not-so-familiar) faces of crime and general villainy in Gotham City. Besides just punching thugs in the face, though, there are some mysteries to solve. A mysterious figure with a personal vendetta against the Batman, known as the Arkham Knight, has come calling with a private army behind him. All at once, Batman must face this Knight and his army, a deadlier-than-ever Scarecrow, and some very real demons of his own.</p>

    <p>Horizon: Zero Dawn is an incredibly original open-world adventure game. Humanity has somehow been reduced to the tribal stages of civilization, and yet high-tech, mechanical beasts roam the open land. Aloy, though an outcast of her tribe, has been trained by the best of hunters. After her people are attacked, she sets out to not only find out who attacked them and why, but also to solve the deep mysteries of humanity's past. The game presents one the greatest open-world environments in gaming history. The world holds many, many secrets and every inch of it is absolutely beautiful. Furthermore, fighting against the primal machines the own that land is intense and never gets old. Every battle is a fight for survival.</p>

  <div class="info">
    <p>Hollow Knight is a relatively simple yet impressive side-scrolling adventure game. The player controls a rather small being, wielding only a nail, whose goal appears to be investigate the source of a deadly infection in a dying underground kingdom of insects. However, while traversing dark, constricting tunnels and silent, open cities, both formed in ages long past by things unremembered, the details of the past and present slowly become more and more complex and almost frightening. The basic combat and adventuring mechanics of the game are simple, but backed by a surprisingly complex system of upgrades and player-controlled bonuses. Both the story and the combat are also accompanied by a strong and memorable soundtrack.</p>
