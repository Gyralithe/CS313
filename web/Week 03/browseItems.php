<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<!-- This was added through VSCode -->

<!-- 
  Ideas:
  Each item listed will be an item in a <ul> with a button at the end that says "Add to Cart"
  Once pressed, that button will make an AJAX call through the JS function addItem()
  The function will pass a number....
  Am I going to have to call a different PHP to add each item?
  Or can I make each button "submit a form" to one PHP file without shifting pages?
